# AC_DC-regulated-var.-power-supply
A beginner electronics project to convert 230V AC to 9V DC using a rectifier and voltage regulator.


## Objective
To convert 230V AC into a regulated 9V DC supply using a full-wave bridge rectifier, capacitor filter, and 7805 voltage regulator.

## Components Used
- Step-down Transformer (230V to 12V)
- Diodes (1N5399)
- Capacitor (2200μF)
- Voltage Regulator (7809)
- LED, Resistors

## Circuit Function
The circuit takes AC input, steps it down, rectifies it, smooths it with a capacitor, and regulates it to provide a constant 5V DC output.
